- Application that solves food problems at IITGN
- This is the shopkeeper app that users can use to make orders from.
  - Can view incoming orders. 
  - Money is paid directly to shopkeepers account.
  - Shopkeeper can adjust availability - disable and enable items that are available at the moment.
  - Direct and realtime feedback from customer - shopkeeper can see what students like
  - Powerful charts and analytics for improving profitability
  - Fully fledged order management system. Receive, pay, and update status of order within the app.
  - All in real-time :)

- This app was made a long time back, and was never deployed due to administrative issues. Open sourcing the code so that someone can take over.
